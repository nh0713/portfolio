The participant also mentioned that he usually tries to buy used books or rent textbooks to save some money, but that option is still a bit expensive and not always available. When asked about his opinion of our textbooks selling website, he said, \u201cit would be great to have another resource that would allow me to get used books at a drastically lower price\u201d. When asked about incidents of him selling textbooks he responded by saying, \u201cI tried selling my books at the U-Book store and other book stores, but they offered around 5 dollars per book which I bought for more than $120 and I felt like that was unfair.

Nevertheless, participants still provided useful information that was implemented in the final design of the website.  First of all, participants did not like the color schemes of either prototypes.

Secondly, participants liked how in Hi-Fi 2, in the search results, it showed a thumbnail picture of the textbook.  Finally, participants felt that there was a lot of empty space.
